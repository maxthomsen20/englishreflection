<p><span><em style="color: blue;">The moment I had been anxiously awaiting was finally here. I stood</em> in front of my 12th grade AP English Language and Composition class and teacher, as they waited for me to begin my presentation. Despite my confidence in the material I was presenting, actually talking about that material in front of an audience was a tremendous struggle for me. I had limited public speaking skills, and would compensate for this by filling my slides to the brim with text, and simply reading off that text during the presentation (terrible, I know).</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, I struggled with the process of analysis, especially when it came to analyzing images or samples of text. The main issue I had was differentiating between summary and analysis. Specifically, my best attempts to analyze a piece of work would always end up looking like a detailed summary of the work, not containing any real critical thinking or new insights.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, being colorblind, I have always struggled with visual communication, specifically the aspect of color choice. I&rsquo;ve never been able to properly match my clothes, fill out the coloring book correctly, or design a presentation that uses an effective color palette to capture the audience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These aforementioned struggles were at the forefront of my thoughts as I began Dr. Michael Lehman&rsquo;s English 1102 course, focused on the theme of border rhetorics. While the course was writing-intensive, it also emphasized multimodal communication through the WOVEN approach: dividing the main modes of communication into written, oral, visual, electronic, and nonverbal. The course focused on texts relating to borders in a larger sense: as more than just physical barriers, but as the basis of an entire genre with a language and rhetoric to describe it. The course thoroughly explored the idea that borders can exist on so many levels and to a wide range of degrees. Borders can exist between cultures, ideas, time periods, values, and even individuals. They can be visible, invisible, or dynamic based on one&rsquo;s perspective. Overall, the course emphasized critical thinking, multimodality, use of rhetoric (largely with respect to borders), and finally it focused on the entire process of writing from brainstorming to the final revisions and reflection upon completion. The course&rsquo;s emphasis on developing multimodal communication skills, specifically through the presentation-oriented projects, challenged me to face my struggles with both the oral and visual mode of communication. Secondly, the course&rsquo;s emphasis on writing as a process rather than a single event, and focus on critical thinking, helped me develop confidence in analyzing content more deeply rather than simply summarizing it.</span></p>
<p><span>The first moment in the course where I had the opportunity to face my lack of presenting skills occurred during the adaptation proposal project. Groups were tasked with pitching an idea for an adaptation of a text that was discussed in class. As we developed our presentation and secured the role of each team member, I made a conscious decision to focus on my weaknesses rather than only relying on what I was good at to make my contribution. Typically, I will spend too much time thinking about how the presentation looks, putting unnecessary effort into the decorations and animations that ultimately does not help to get the point across (if used in moderation, however, it can enhance the flow of the presentation). Instead, I decided to put the majority of my effort into improving my presentation skills. To do this, I wrote a rough script of what I wanted to say and first practiced in front of a mirror using the script. Eventually, I became confident enough to where I didn&rsquo;t need to look at the script and could speak simply from memory. Through this process, I had the revelation that if I am well rehearsed in speaking about a topic, I will not be as nervous when in front of an audience, and can therefore focus my energy on projecting my voice, and speaking confidently and enthusiastically, rather than worrying about what exactly I will be saying!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly, the production of artifact 0, the diagnostic video, gave me the opportunity to isolate one of my weaknesses in the category of oral communication: speaking clearly, loudly, and with ease. My first takes when shooting the video were quiet, with my head down and back arched, which led to a weak delivery of the message. I spent multiple takes watching myself and actively making small improvements with each take. The final product may not have been TED-talk ready, but I felt that my speaking and body language had greatly improved.&nbsp;</span></p>
